# Icewind Dale II Voice Pack for EE 2.6+

## Overview
This mod adds the new voicesets added in Icewind Dale II to the Infinity Engine (Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate II/Icewind Dale) Enhanced Edition games version 2.6 or above.
Does not include the voicesets reused from Icewind Dale 1.

## Limitations
Icewind Dale II supports 2 "Critical Hit" responses. EE games only support a single response which led to one of these responses getting unused and cut.

## Version history
### 1.0.1

Fix Female Monk referencing Female Barbarian voice.

### 1.0.0
Initial release.
Adds the 12 new sets from IWD2.
